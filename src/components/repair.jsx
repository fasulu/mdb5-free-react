                        <p>Birmingham City Council aims to provide homes that are clean, safe and ready to move into. We have an empty property repair standard and our repairs contractors work to this standard to make sure that homes are fit to live in.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Gardens</strong></p>

                        <li>Non-standard fittings are improvements such as showers, fire surrounds and verandas that the previous tenant fitted and are a tenantâ€™s responsibility to maintain. We will check these are safe and suitable for use before leaving them in place. These will NOT be replaced once it becomes too expensive to repair them, and we will then remove them.</li>
                        <li>You should report all other non-urgent repairs to the repairs call centre for your area.</li>
                    </ul>
